<div class="text-center">
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  I made this website for my friends and family to track the hikes near them and eventually I plan on creating a logging in function where my freinds
  can comment on the hikes they have completed and also I would like to add google maps API using the hikes latitude and longitude.
